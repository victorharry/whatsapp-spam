# Wpp Spam

> Made in Brazil

## What is this?
Wpp Spam is an application written in NodeJS that allows you to send message spam to your friends through WhatsApp. The bot will continue sending messages within the predefined interval until the victim responds with anything, thus successfully calling them.

## What do I need?

`node` above version **6**.

## Installation

`sudo npm install -g wpp-spam`

You will have the `wpp-spam` command available globally.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required        | Description                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--phone` | :white_check_mark: | Victim's phone number.                        |
| `--message`  | :white_check_mark: | Message that will be sent.                      |
| `--seconds`   |                    | Time interval in seconds between sending messages. |

### Example

`wpp-spam --phone '553198988787' --message "Let's play ðŸŽ®" --seconds 10` :shipit:

Notes:

After running it will show a QRCode, read it with your whatsapp to connect and send the messages.

The default time interval is 1 second and nothing below 1 will be accepted to avoid being banned.

## Formatting messages
